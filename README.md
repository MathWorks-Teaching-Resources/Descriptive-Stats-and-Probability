# Descriptive Statistics and Probability Distributions [![View <File Exchange Title> on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/####-Phase-Plane-and-Slope-Field) or [Open in MATLAB Online](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Descriptive-Stats-and-Probability&project=StatsAndProb.prj)
**Curriculum Module in collaboration with Ward Nickle, Humboldt State University**  
_Created with R2020a. Compatible with R2020a and later releases._


## Description ##
This package contains _[live scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html)_ centered around the fundamentals 
of descriptive statistics and some commonly used probability distributions. These materials are designed to be flexible and can be 
easily modified to accommodate a variety of teaching and learning methods. Used in a sequence, the live scripts progressively add depth 
to the topic. However, each script can be easily adapted for standalone use. It includes a brief background, interactive illustrations, 
tasks, reflection questions, and example problems for the different concepts explored.
