**Curriculum Module**

_Created with R2020a. Compatible with R2020a and later releases._

# Information

This curriculum module contains interactive [MATLAB® live scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html) that teach the fundamentals of descriptive statistics and some commonly used probability distributions.

<a name="H_F00D98E4"></a>
## Background

You can use these live scripts as demonstrations in lectures, class activities, or interactive assignments outside class. This module covers descriptive statistics such as mean, median, range, variance and standard deviation and visualizations such as histograms and boxplots. Additional scripts address discrete and continuous probability distributions including the binomial and Poisson distributions as well as the uniform, normal, and exponential distributions. 


The instructions inside the live scripts will guide you through the exercises and activities. Get started with each live script by running it one section at a time. To stop running the script or a section midway (for example, when an animation is in progress), use the <img src="Images/EndIcon.png" width="19" alt="EndIcon.png"> Stop button in the **RUN** section of the **Live Editor** tab in the MATLAB Toolstrip.

## Getting Started
### Accessing the Module
### **On MATLAB Online:**

Use the [<img src="Images/OpenInMO.png" width="136" alt="OpenInMO.png">](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Descriptive-Stats-and-Probability&project=StatsAndProb.prj) link to download the module. You will be prompted to log in or create a MathWorks account. The project will be loaded, and you will see an app with several navigation options to get you started.

### **On Desktop:**

Download or clone this repository. Open MATLAB, navigate to the folder containing these scripts and double-click on [StatsAndProb.prj](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Descriptive-Stats-and-Probability&project=StatsAndProb.prj). It will add the appropriate files to your MATLAB path and open an app that asks you where you would like to start. 


Ensure you have all the required products ([listed below](#H_E850B4FF)) installed. If you need to include a product, add it using the Add-On Explorer.
